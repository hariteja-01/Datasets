## 🤝 Contributing

Contributions are welcome! If you have a dataset that would benefit others, please follow these steps:

### Adding a New Dataset

1. **Fork** this repository
2. **Create** a new branch (`git checkout -b add-dataset-name`)
3. **Add** your dataset to the appropriate category folder
4. **Include** a README.md in the dataset folder with:
   - Dataset name and description
   - Source and attribution
   - Column/field descriptions
   - Any preprocessing steps applied
   - Suggested use cases
5. **Commit** your changes (`git commit -m 'Add [dataset-name]'`)
6. **Push** to your branch (`git push origin add-dataset-name`)
7. **Create** a Pull Request

### Dataset Submission Checklist

- [ ] Dataset is properly formatted and cleaned
- [ ] README.md included with metadata
- [ ] Proper attribution to original source
- [ ] No personally identifiable information (PII) unless properly anonymized
- [ ] Dataset is legal to share and properly licensed
- [ ] File size is reasonable (large files should use Git LFS)

## 📋 Dataset Guidelines

### What to Include

- **Clean, validated data** that's ready to use
- **Documentation** explaining the dataset structure
- **Source attribution** for proper credit

### What NOT to Include

- ❌ Datasets with sensitive personal information
- ❌ Copyrighted data without permission
- ❌ Low-quality or corrupted files
- ❌ Extremely large files without Git LFS (>100MB)

### Best Practices

1. **Use common formats**: CSV, JSON, or Parquet for tabular data
2. **Consistent naming**: Use descriptive, lowercase names with hyphens
3. **Include metadata**: Always document your dataset
4. **Test your data**: Ensure it loads without errors
